## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - MONGODB_URI
# - OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t forecaster .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local forecaster
```

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
