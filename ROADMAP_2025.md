# Forecaster Long-Term Roadmap (3-6 Months)

## Overview
This roadmap outlines architectural and operational improvements for the Forecaster weather planning application, focusing on testing, monitoring, automation, and internationalization.

## Timeline & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)
- E2E Testing with Playwright
- Structured Logging Implementation

### Phase 2: Automation & Monitoring (Month 2-3)
- CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Sentry Integration & Performance Monitoring

### Phase 3: Global Reach (Month 4-6)
- Internationalization (i18n) Implementation
- Multi-language Support

## 3.1 E2E Testing with Playwright

### Justification
End-to-end testing ensures critical user flows work correctly across different browsers and devices. For Forecaster, this is crucial because:
- File upload and GPX parsing are complex operations
- Map rendering involves external libraries (OpenLayers)
- Weather data integration requires API coordination
- PDF export functionality needs cross-browser validation

### Implementation Plan

#### Week 1-2: Setup & Configuration
1. Install Playwright and configure test environment
2. Set up test data and fixtures
3. Create page object models for reusability

#### Week 3-4: Core Test Implementation
1. File upload â†’ GPX parsing flow
2. Map rendering and interaction tests
3. Weather chart generation and interaction
4. PDF export functionality

#### Week 5-6: Advanced Scenarios
1. Error handling and edge cases
2. Mobile responsiveness tests
3. Performance and accessibility tests

### Key Benefits
- **Reliability**: Catch regressions before deployment
- **Confidence**: Ensure critical paths always work
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Cross-browser**: Validate functionality across browsers

### Next Steps
